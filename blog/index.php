    What’s up at Ernst & Young?

  <img style="width:300px;height:300px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Ernst_%26_Young_Corporate_Logo.svg/225px-Ernst_%26_Young_Corporate_Logo.svg.png"><br><br>

    <p>The last few months have been very eventful here at Ernst &amp; Young! In the summer months, if you spent any time ina major Canadian airport, you might have noticed EY’s new ad campaign; or if you were at one of the Canadian Cirque du Soleil shows recently, you’ve probably seen our show-stopping partnership with Cirque du Soleil! The great news to us, at the firm, is that we can get great discounts on their show tickets – what a sweet deal!</p>
<p>Another connection Cirque du Soleil has with EY is that its founder and CEO, Guy Laliberté, is the winner of Ernst &amp; Young’s 2007 World Entrepreneur Of The Year Award. (<a href="http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year']);">http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year</a>). While this year’s judging is still underway, the Ontario EOY winner was presented on October 10 at the Metro Toronto Convention Center to John A. McCluskey of Alamos Gold Inc. Check back with us on the World EOY awards (held in Monaco)!</p>
<p>At Ernst &amp; Young, we don’t only recognize the success of entrepreneurs, we also support the cultivation of future entrepreneurs. We are a national partner with the Next 36 program, fuelling the careers of “Canada’s most promising and innovative undergraduates”. Check out the amazing stories at <a href="http://thenext36.ca" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://thenext36.ca']);">http://thenext36.ca</a>.</p>
<p>And for those of us who are not in the entrepreneurial space, perhaps you’re an intrepreneur? A new term for you? Get a head start here: <a href="http://ecubation.com/blog/intrepreneur-is-the-ultimate-employee/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://ecubation.com/blog/intrepreneur-is-the-ultimate-employee/']);">http://ecubation.com/blog/intrepreneur-is-the-ultimate-employee/</a></p>
<p>Finally, how can we forget to mention the latest Trent Henry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ernst &amp; Young Canada, interview on his views of EY’s renowned People First philosophy. It’s a highly recommended read: <a href="http://careerinsiderbusiness.ca/2012/a-people-first-philosophy/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://careerinsiderbusiness.ca/2012/a-people-first-philosophy/']);">http://careerinsiderbusiness.ca/2012/a-people-first-philosophy/</a></p>

  <h2>
  How to Botch Your Career
  </h2><br><br>

  <img src="http://start-a-business-canada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/certified-management-accountant.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;"/><br><br>

  <p>Josh Linker, author of Disciplined Dreaming, delivered a powerful message at the CMA Ontario Strategic Management Conference earlier this year. Enjoy Josh’s October 2012 Blog Post that will help you Create Possibilities for your career.</p>
<h3>HOW TO BOTCH YOUR CAREER</h3>
<p>Your parents probably gave you loving advice on how to land a job and work your way up the ladder. Unfortunately, that advice is likely dead wrong. While their intentions were probably noble, the world has changed so dramatically in the last few years that the golden nuggets of the past have become the anchors of the present.</p>
<p>In today’s intensely complex, fast, and competitive world, yesterday’s platitudes simply won’t cut it. If you want to reach your full potential, you’ll need to take an entirely different approach. The rate of change today is like none other in history, so it is incumbent upon you to adopt the new rules of engagement. On the other hand, if you are looking for a fast-pass to mediocrity, follow these six time-tested steps to botch your career:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Just do what you’re told</strong> – Even though you’ve been taught since grade school to follow instructions, just doing the minimum today will chain your career trajectory to the floor. Instead, you should be delivering each project or assignment with an “and some.” Use each task as an opportunity to contribute above and beyond what was asked. Add a new insight, research finding, or extra goodie, and your work will shine compared to that of your bare-minimum colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your opinions to yourself</strong> – In the Industrial Age, leaders made all the decisions while workers seldom contributed ideas. In the Brain Age, however, you will advance the fastest if you are a constant source of fresh thinking. Share your perspective and let your imagination shine.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for permission</strong> – Success favors action, so you’re far better off asking for forgiveness than permission. This applies not only to making an impact in your role, but also for your own personal development. Don’t wait for your company or boss to teach you what you need to know. Take full ownership of your own personal growth and development. The library is never closed.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the set path</strong> – Unless you want to slowly climb the soulless ranks, paving your own path is a far better route. Invent a new job, make a business case for radical change, or experiment with a non-traditional approach. The leaders we celebrate – from Edison to Jobs – consistently took the path less travelled.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace loopholes</strong> – You might get off the hook in the near term, but you are far better off taking full responsibility for outcomes instead of covering your ass or pointing fingers. Don’t trade short-term relief for long-term opportunity. Those that reach the highest peaks assume complete accountability for their actions.</li>
<li><strong>Blend in</strong> – Being confused for a colleague or competitor is the highest form of insult. The great ones always stand for something. They cannot be ignored. There is no longer safety in packs; winning today requires standing out as a “category of one.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Old wives tales and traditional thinking have become about as useful as rotary phones. Charles Darwin famously said, “It is not the strongest of the species nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.”</p>
<p>Unless you are content with living small, it’s time to ignore the conventional wisdom of the past and forge ahead to a brighter future. Darwin would be proud!</p>

    Career Flexibility
  </h2>

<p><img src="../images/partners/cga.jpg" alt="" title="we_see_more" style="width:600px;height:300px;" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2785"><br>
Flexibility.</p>
<p>It’s something that can benefit you in both your career and your future studies.</p>
<p>With recruitment season continuing, graduate school fairs and applications around the corner it can be a stressful time for decision making. </p>
<p>Keeping your career options open can pay big dividends in your professional development.</p>
<p>Make sure you participate in as many employer visits, networking sessions and recruitment events as you can on and off campus. You never know who you’ll meet or how it could influence your career path.</p>
<p>Today, accountants can be far from what you would stereotypically expect. Like LIVE Conference, our CGAs span across business in marketing, human resources, tech industry and start-ups. </p>
<p>The need for employees with strong accounting skills that can see more than numbers within the business are vital. </p>
<p>Getting your CGA designation can help you do more with your career and gives you flexibility to pursue your career passions. </p>
<p>Having the ability to complete the CGA program part-time through our Online Learning Environment (OLE) gives you the added flexibility to start your career right from university while gaining industry focused learning.</p>
<p>We’ve got an event coming up with our keynote speaker Greg Twinney, CGA, CFO/COO at Kobo Inc. Before he helped build the Canadian e-reader giant (Kobo) he completed the CGA program while raising capital for several large start-up companies. As a lifelong entrepreneur he’s not exactly your typical accountant.<br />
He is, however; a typical certified general accountant.</p>
<p>Pursuing his career after graduating from college, he leveraged his analytics skills from the CGA program with his passion – in this case, business operations.<br />
Discovering his career path was a journey designed around hard work and flexibility.<br />
My point is, you never know where your career might take you.</p>
<p>keeping your career options flexible can be a major asset in your success.</p>
<p>Enjoy the process of your career development and gain experience in all you do.</p>

    CMA Ontario – Your Career Partner for Life… Starting Now!
  </h2><br><br>

  <img src="http://start-a-business-canada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/certified-management-accountant.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;"/><br><br>

  <p>As per the fine folks at Wikipedia, &#8220;Recruitment refers to the process of attracting, screening, and selecting a qualified person for a job.&#8221; By very definition, recruitment is a process undertaken by an organization to find the right people &#8211; it is not a process undertaken by people (in your particular case, a UTM student) to find the right organization. In life, however, success in building a great career takes personal effort, persistence and support from valued partners. Relying on recruitment activity from hiring organizations is only part of the process.</p>
<p>As an aspiring business professional, one of the most valuable choices you can make in supporting your career is finding a career partner for life &#8211; a partner that will not only help you develop your skills and competencies to build a strong foundation, but a partner who will support your ongoing professional development so you can evolve and succeed throughout your entire career journey. The Certified Management Accountants of Ontario is one such partner!</p>
<p>Starting today, you can become a CMA Student Associate in order to access great benefits such as the <strong>CMA Student Employment Program</strong>. This program will provide you with weekly updates containing helpful career advice and job postings available to CMA Student Associates and professional program candidates. The table shown here is a small sample of CMA job postings (internship, contract, permanent) from the past three months. As you can see, CMA-bound students &amp; candidates are sought after for a wide variety of roles across many industry segments.</p>
<p>No matter what year you are in, it is valuable to read these job postings to learn more about various positions and discover what jobs interest you. You can see what companies are looking for (e.g. advanced IT / computer skills) and find helpful terms to use on your résumé. You will also discover that many positions combine accounting with other business functions such as marketing, operations, IT, finance and analytics &#8211; a fact that makes CMA a very valuable designation to pursue.</p>
<p>While job postings show you the current hiring needs of an organization, you should also start establishing relationships with employers in order to get to know their corporate culture and better understand if you are a good &#8216;fit&#8217;. Meeting employers at special events and career fairs is a great start. As a CMA Student Associate, you will have special access to &#8220;<strong>Connections 2012</strong>&#8220;, CMA Ontario&#8217;s Fall Career &amp; Networking Fair on Oct. 4 where great employers such as Loblaw, Sun Life, Linamar and Manulife Financial will be present. You can pick-up more career-related info and advice from guest speakers who will be presenting at Connections.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, CMA Student Associates can book 1-on-1 career coaching sessions with the <strong>Career Services Dept. </strong>to improve areas such as your resume, interview skills or LinkedIn profile. Helpful tips will also be sent in the <strong>Weekly Student Job Newsletter</strong>, such as &#8220;What is your greatest weakness?&#8221; &#8211; tips on handling this classic interview question; &#8220;Résumé redundancies&#8221; &#8211; maximize your résumé by avoiding duplication; or &#8220;How To Get Head Hunted Using Your LinkedIn Account&#8221;.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, professional networking can be the most powerful way to connect with new job opportunities. CMA Student Associates can access the <strong>CMA Member Network </strong>both on-line or through CMA district events. Take advantage of this valuable platform to meet CMAs from industries that interest you and start building your professional network. To learn more and sign-up as a CMA Student Associate, please visit www.cmaontario.org and click on &#8220;Become a CMA Student Associate&#8221; under the heading: &#8220;Become A CMA&#8221;. This small investment in your career could provide a big return! Questions? Please contact Mira Sirotic, CMA, msirotic@cmaontario.org, 416-482-5556 or visit www.becomeacma.com.</p>

    Simple Recruitment Season Tips
    </h2>

    <img src="../images/partners/cga.jpg" alt="" title="we_see_more" style="width:600px;height:300px;" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2785">
<p>Recruitment season is in full swing for you guys in a variety of industries from accounting to marketing.</p>
<p>Career fairs, socials, speed networking… Are you ready?</p>
<p>Events like LIVE Conference 2012 are great places to practice your networking skills before that big interview with the firm or CPG recruiter. I thought it would be a good idea to share a few tips I’ve got from some of our certified general accountants (CGAs) that have been through the pressures of recruitment season before.<br />
Body language can play a big part during interviews.</p>
<p>“In my view it’s paramount to your success both professionally and personally,” Marc Morin, CGA and audit team lead at the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) explains.</p>
<p>As a Toastmaster Society member, Marc’s gained much experience improving his professional communications. As he explains, keeping good posture, eye contact and eating etiquette are all part of the process. Focus on how you’re listening and engaging at events just as much as your verbal communication.</p>
<p>Recruiters see hundreds of candidates and it’s important to set a strong first impression with these simple gestures.</p>
<p>Sean Anklesaria, CGA, business development manager, CGA Ontario, builds relationships with top employers across the industry and used to work for Deloitte.</p>
<p>“Recognize and take stock of the transferable skills you’ve attained on internships, co-ops and in student associations,” Sean says. “Work on your elevator pitch, ask lots of questions and make a great first impression this fall!”</p>
<p>Practice your 30 second elevator pitch at LIVE and make the most of your connections. Follow us on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/CGA_DoMore" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://twitter.com/CGA_DoMore']);">@CGA_DoMore</a> for more tips. See you there!<br />
