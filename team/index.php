  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>Entering her second year in the Management program, Luxshiani is an enthusiastic bundle of energy who has big dreams, and is not afraid to work hard to attain them. Subsequent to Luxshiani’s active role with the Management and Economics Students’ Association (MESA), she went on to land a position as one of LIVE’s Corporate Relations Managers. One of her primary reasons for joining the LIVE Executive team is to step outside of her comfort zone and develop her interpersonal skills. Amongst the Corporate Relations team, Luxshiani is known as the “T.L.” (Team Leader) because of her ability to keep the rest of the team grounded (she’s the only girl!). In Luxshiani’s spare time, she likes to find opportunities to volunteer around campus to keep active with the community. Luxshiani is ecstatic to work alongside her team in shaping LIVE Competition’s success.</p>
